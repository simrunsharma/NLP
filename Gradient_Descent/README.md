## Importance of Gradient Descent in Natural Language Processing and Language Models (LLMs)

Gradient Descent holds significant importance in the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Language Models, such as ChatGPT, particularly in the context of the provided assignment:

1. **Optimization of Language Models:**
   - Gradient Descent is crucial for training Language Models (LMs) like ChatGPT. It optimizes the models by iteratively adjusting the model parameters to minimize the loss function, enhancing the accuracy and performance of the model.

2. **Loss Minimization:**
   - In NLP, Loss functions quantify the disparity between predicted outputs (generated text) and ground truth (actual text). Gradient Descent aids in minimizing this loss by iteratively updating model weights, leading to more accurate predictions.

3. **Enhanced Predictive Power:**
   - Gradient Descent helps fine-tune the parameters of LLMs, improving their predictive capabilities. Models like ChatGPT can generate more contextually relevant and coherent responses to input queries.

4. **Model Convergence:**
   - Through Gradient Descent, the model converges to a state where the loss is minimized, indicating that the model has effectively learned the underlying patterns and complexities in the training data.

5. **Parameter Adjustment:**
   - LLMs have a vast number of parameters that require fine-tuning. Gradient Descent facilitates the adjustment of these parameters, optimizing the model's ability to understand and generate natural language.

In the context of the provided assignment, understanding and implementing Gradient Descent is essential. It enables the efficient optimization of loss functions, enhancing the performance of Language Models like ChatGPT. By visualizing the loss and token probabilities, the assignment focuses on demonstrating the effectiveness of gradient-based optimization in the realm of NLP.

## Gradient Descent Assignment 

To implement gradient descent, begin with the provided `unigram_pytorch.py` script. Follow these steps to build visualizations and achieve efficient results:
- **Set Parameters:**
   - Choose a suitable `num_iterations` and `learning_rate` to optimize the gradient descent process.
-  **Build Visualizations:**
   - Augment the script to create visualizations for:
     - Loss as a function of time/iteration, including the known minimum possible loss for comparison.
     - Final token probabilities, comparing them to the known optimal probabilities.
-  **Optimization:**
   - Tweak `num_iterations` and `learning_rate` to achieve reasonably good results within seconds, aiming for efficient convergence.

In summary, by carefully selecting appropriate parameters and integrating visualizations into the gradient descent process, the goal is to efficiently optimize the loss function and achieve accurate token probabilities while comparing them to the known optimal values.
