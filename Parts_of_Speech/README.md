## Why Hidden Markov Model and Viterbi Algorithm are Useful for POS Tagging

**1. Modeling Sequential Data:**
   - Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are ideal for POS tagging as they model sequential data where the current state (POS tag) depends on the previous state, which aligns with the word sequence in sentences.

**2. Markov Property:**
   - HMMs adhere to the Markov property, where the probability of the current state (POS tag) depends solely on the previous state. This is a suitable assumption for POS tagging, where a word's POS is influenced by the preceding word's POS.

**3. Probabilistic Framework:**
   - HMMs offer a probabilistic framework to model transitions between POS tags and emissions (observations) of words based on these POS tags. The transition matrix models the likelihood of moving from one POS tag to another, and the observation matrix models the likelihood of a word being emitted given a POS tag.

**4. Efficient State Sequencing:**
   - The Viterbi algorithm efficiently determines the most probable sequence of POS tags (states) for a given sentence, considering both transition probabilities between POS tags and the emission probabilities of words for those tags.

**5. Handling Ambiguity:**
   - HMMs handle word ambiguity by assigning probabilities to each possible POS tag for a word, enabling accurate tagging by choosing the most likely sequence based on these probabilities.

**6. Smoothing and OOV Handling:**
   - HMMs handle out-of-vocabulary words through smoothing techniques, ensuring the model can make predictions for unknown words based on transition and emission probabilities.

**7. Scalability and Adaptability:**
   - HMMs can be adapted to different languages and domains by training on appropriate tagged corpora. The Viterbi algorithm allows for efficient and fast tagging, making it applicable to large-scale text processing tasks.

In summary, Hidden Markov Models, coupled with the Viterbi algorithm, provide a powerful probabilistic framework for accurately predicting POS tags in natural language sentences. These tools are fundamental in various natural language processing applications.

## Part-of-Speech Tagging Assignment 

To generate the components of a part-of-speech hidden Markov model using the universal tagset, the first 10k tagged sentences from the Brown corpus are utilized. The following steps are taken to achieve this:

- Use the `nltk.corpus.brown.tagged_sents(tagset='universal')[:10000]` command to obtain the tagged sentences for analysis.
- Extract and analyze the transition matrix, observation matrix, and initial state distribution for the hidden Markov model.
- Maintain mappings between states/observations and indices, including handling out-of-vocabulary (OOV) or unknown (UNK) observations, and implement necessary smoothing techniques.
- Utilize the provided Viterbi implementation to infer the sequence of states for sentences 10150-10152 of the Brown corpus using the command `nltk.corpus.brown.tagged_sents(tagset='universal')[10150:10153]`.
- Compare the inferred POS tag sequence against the ground truth and provide an explanation for the accuracy or discrepancies produced by the POS tagger.
